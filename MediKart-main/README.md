## How Stripe Payment Works:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c2cbfbf-4d47-4073-9682-b60297259b7f)
1. When customers are ready to complete their purchase, your application creates a new Checkout Session.
2. The Checkout Session provides a URL that redirects customers to a Stripe-hosted payment page.
3. Customers enter their payment details on the payment page and complete the transaction.
4. After the transaction, a webhook fulfills the order using the checkout.session.completed event.

## API Endpoints
- **User Routes**:
  - POST `/api/createUser`: Register a new user.
  - POST `/api/loginUser`: Authenticate a user and return a JWT.
- **Product Routes**:
  - GET `/api/displayData`: Fetch all products data.
- **Order Routes**:
  - POST `/api/orderData`: Create a new order.
  - GET `/api/myorderData`: Fetch all orders for a specific user.
- **Payment Routes**:

## User Authentication

User authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage and to check for bots recaptcha is utilized to boost security aginst brute force attacks. Upon successful login, a token is generated and stored in the client's local storage to maintain the session.

## Data Handling

The application segregates user-specific data to ensure personalized experiences. The product data is maintained on the back-end and is fetched from the front-end using API calls. Each user's order history and cart data are managed individually to provide a tailored shopping experience.
